  <p>In January of 1985, I was birthed into this world one frigid cold morning in a hospital in Manhassett, NY. The first two years of my life I lived with my parents in a small garden apartment in Glen Oaks, Queens.  After my mom became pregant with my younger sister they decided it was time to move into a home.  So they packed up all our belongings and we moved out east on Long Island to a split level home in the suburbs.</p>

  <p>We were a middle class family. There was always food on the table and clothes on our backs.  I am so thankful for that.  We were very blessed with finances and provision. Everything I needed and wanted my parents were able to provide. They were able to send my sister and me to a private high school which was a pretty big sacrifice financially but we both excelled and were able to get into great colleges. I can't remember a moment when we were without a family pet.  Always had either a dog or two, ferrets, birds, a turtle, some fish, my pet crayfish in middle school, cats, you name it. Animal lovers to say the least.</p>

  <p>I began playing soccer at the age of 12 and it became one of the loves of my life. Some of my fondest memories are of playing soccer both JV and Varsity in High School and also for travel teams.  I loved the bonds that were formed with my teammates.  I loved the competitveness of the sport as well as the skills and strategies of the game.  What I loved the most was how much fun I had while playing. Whether I was doing a give and go with a teammate, receiving a pass that set me up for a breakaway towards the opposing team's goal, or defending our goal on defense, I felt so alive and my heart was in it's happy place.</p>

  <p>Home life wasn't always peaches and cream. There were many challenges and rough days.  But looking back I have no regrets, for those moments are the ones that shaped and molded me into the person that I am today. My parents taught me respect, commitment, love, time management, and that I am not a quitter.  When I first began to play soccer I could barely run one lap around the field without gasping for air and feeling like I was going to pass out.  I was very out of shape.  I told my dad that I wanted to quit, that soccer wasn't for me.  He sat me down and told me that I wasn't a quitter.  He said you haven't even really given it a shot yet.  He asked me to finish out the season and then if by the end of it I still wanted to quit than I could.  I am so glad he said that to me.  I stuck it out and gave it my all.  Till this day I still love the sport and play it too.  If I would have quit back then I would have missed out on so many memories and moments that I now cherish.  I can still see and hear my father that day I wanted to quit.  It is a moment I will never forget.  I give things a chance and carry them through rather than quitting when times get tough. A quality I hope to one day teach my children.</p>
